Then flip over, and place your hands where your butt was, and your feet just in front of the wall. Your hands should be shoulder-width apart with fingers spread, and rotated forward, not inward. Essentially, you're in a downward-dog position. From here, practice distributing all your weight to the front of your feet, until you're on the tips of your toes.\nNext, start to slowly walk your feet up the wall behind you, with bent legs. Be sure to press more weight into your hands, and your whole foot into the wall. If your arms feel strong enough to handle the weight, keep walking up the wall, activating your arms, shoulders, upper chest, and core as you do so.\nContinue practicing walking up the wall until you feel confident, stable, and strong. Make sure you aren't hyperextending your elbows—keeping a slight bend limits the impact on the arm joints and also prevents the arms from caving in. Stabilize your entire body by pulling in your abdomen and engaging your core. To prevent your shoulders from coming up to your ears, lift from your lower belly. Your legs should always be engaged.\nLittle by little, walk your feet up the wall until your body makes a right angle, with knees slightly bent. \nNext step: lifting up those legs. Begin by lifting one leg up. Make sure your legs are rotated slightly inward—this helps keep the position of the spine vertical. And don't forget about your feet! They can be pointed, flexed, or a combination of both called “Barbie doll” feet, a.k.a. pointed feet with toes flexed back. Activated feet help to engage the entire body, just like standing upright. \nOnce you feel comfortable with one leg off the wall, it's time to move on to the next challenge. Extend both legs long and straight, with toes resting against the wall. You can either hold this pose for more practice, or, when you're ready, gently kick off that wall. The first time you do this, you may want to get an extra set of eyes (or hands) to help you out. Also, make sure the room is clear of furniture, just in case. If you feel unstable, just reach your feet back toward the wall. \nOnce you nail your handstand, practice gracefully falling out of it. One method is to try bending your knees and turning your fall into a cartwheel, Zaki says.\nBenefits\nHandstands get the blood circulating and give you an energy boost.\n",
